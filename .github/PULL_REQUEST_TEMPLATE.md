ðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Bespoke!

If this is a simple docs change, go ahead and delete all this.

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a
lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we
request that contributors create a
[Feature Request discussion](https://github.com/bespoke-surf/bespoke/discussions/categories/ideas)
to first discuss any significant new features.
