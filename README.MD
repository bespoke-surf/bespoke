2. Initial setup

   ```sh
   ~/bespoke$: yarn setup
   ```

3. Run both `web` and `server` using turbo repo in parallel mode:

   ```sh

   ```

   ‚ÑπÔ∏è we recommed not running it parallel.

   ```sh
   ~/bespoke/apps/web$: yarn dev

   ```

   ```sh

This starts your app in development mode.

## Deploying Bespoke

Bespoke comes with a GitHub Action that handles automatically deploying your app to production environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

1.  Install, sign up and login to [Fly](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

2.  Create two apps on Fly, one for web and one for server:
    ```sh
    fly apps create [your-app-name]-web
    fly apps create [your-app-name]-server
    ```
3.  Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.
4.  Dealing with Bespoke Web

    1. Add the following secrets to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

       ```sh
       fly secrets set FRONTEND_HOST= BACKEND_HOST= FLY_BACKEND_HOST= SENTRY_DSN= POSTHOG_TOKEN= POSTHOG_ORGANISATION= POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID= CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_IMAGE_URL= CLOUDINARY_PRESET= OPEN_SOURCE=true --app [your-app-name]-web
       ```

    2. Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET_REGION`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFRONT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT` to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in Gihub. This is used during docker container build.

    3. For the initial `fly deploy` you can use:

       ```sh
         ~/bespoke$: yarn deploy:web
       ```

5.  Dealing with Bespoke Server

    1.  Add to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

        ```sh
        fly secrets set HOST= FRONTEND_HOST= FRONTEND_HOST_PROTOCOL= SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= SES_REGION= SES_SENDING_RATE= REDIS_URL= UNLAYER_SECRET= OPEN_SOURCE=true EMAIL_DOMAIN= SUPPORT_EMAIL= SENTRY_DSN= POSTHOG_KEY= --app [your-app-name]-server
        ```

    2.  Create a Fly [Postgres Cluster](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/getting-started/create-pg-cluster/)

    3.  [Attach](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/managing/attach-detach/) Postgres Cluster to Bespoke Server

    4.  Create a [Redis instance](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/). Add `REDIS_URL` to fly secrets
    5.  For the initial `fly deploy` you can use:

        ```sh
         ~/bespoke$: yarn deploy:server
        ```

Now that everything is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your main branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment.

<br>

## Contributing

1. Create a new branch
   - `git checkout -b my-new-branch`
2. Commit your changes
   - `git commit -a -m 'Description of the changes'`
     - There are many ways of doing this and this is just a suggestion
3. Push your branch to GitHub
